### Title:

Use Standard CSS for Styling

### Context:

- The project requires basic styling to create a clean user interface.
- The application is relatively small in scope, with limited components and straightforward styling needs.
- Alternatives like Sass, Less, or Tailwind CSS offer additional features (e.g., variables, mixins, utility classes) but also introduce learning curves and potential overhead.
- Team familiarity and ease of maintenance were prioritized in the decision-making process.

### Decision:

We decided to use standard CSS for styling the project because:

- The project’s simplicity does not justify the added complexity or setup required by Sass, Less, or Tailwind CSS.
- Standard CSS provides all the functionality needed to meet the styling requirements without additional tools.
- It avoids unnecessary dependencies, keeping the codebase lean and reducing build tooling setup.
- The team has sufficient expertise with standard CSS, minimizing onboarding time and potential errors.

### Consequences:

Positive: Simplifies development and maintenance due to reduced tooling complexity. No additional configuration or dependencies are required.
Negative: Missing out on features like variables, nesting, and utility-first design that could have improved scalability or reduced repetitive CSS in larger projects.
Risks: If the project grows beyond its initial scope, refactoring to introduce a CSS preprocessor or utility framework may become necessary.

### Alternatives Considered:

Sass or Less: Rejected because the project does not require advanced features like nesting or variables, and the additional setup would be overkill for the current scope.
Tailwind CSS: Rejected due to unfamiliarity with the utility-first approach, which would require additional learning time. Additionally, Tailwind’s strengths are better suited for larger, more complex projects.
