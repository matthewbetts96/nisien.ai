### Title:

Use MUI (Material-UI) for UI Components

### Context:

The project requires a UI component library to speed up development, ensure design consistency, and provide a professional appearance.
The team wants a library that offers a wide range of prebuilt, accessible components with customization options.
Alternatives considered include Ant Design, Chakra UI, and Bootstrap.
MUI’s material design principles align well with the project's desired look and feel.

### Decision:

We decided to use MUI (Material-UI) as the primary UI library because:

- It provides a comprehensive set of components that follow Google’s Material Design, giving the project a modern and polished look.
- The library has excellent documentation and active community support, making it easy to integrate and extend.
- MUI’s theming and styling system (e.g., styled() API and CSS-in-JS support) enables extensive customization while maintaining consistency.
- The team has prior experience with MUI, reducing the learning curve.

### Consequences:

Positive: Faster development with ready-to-use components, consistent design, and good accessibility out of the box. Customizing the design system is straightforward with MUI’s theming capabilities.
Negative: MUI relies on a CSS-in-JS approach by default, which can introduce performance overhead in larger projects or conflict with existing styling methodologies.
Risks: Future design needs might deviate from Material Design principles, requiring additional customization to maintain alignment.

### Alternatives Considered:

Ant Design: Rejected because it has a more corporate and formal aesthetic. However, Ant Design would have also worked perfectly well with this project.
Chakra UI: Rejected due to a smaller ecosystem and a less comprehensive set of components compared to MUI, as well as no experience with the library.
Bootstrap: Rejected because its default styles and grid system felt outdated and less flexible compared to modern libraries like MUI.
